## CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION


1) Abstract for the dataset

4) Geographic location of data collection:  
*[Location of the data collection.]*  
*[If you include coordinates use format: "latitude, longitude" where latitude and longitude are preferably in fraction of degrees (a decimal number), not sexagesimal, and where north latitude is positive (south is negative) and east longitude is positive (west is negative).]*  
*[If you include a Bounding box indicate Label, Latitude North, Latitude South, Longitude West, Longitude East]*



5) Funding sources that supported the collection of the data:  
*[Include agency and grant number if applicable]*

## VERSIONING AND PROVENANCE


1) Last modification date  
*[Date dataset was last modified in format YYYY-MM-DD]*


2) Links/relationships to other versions of this dataset:  
*[If there are previous versions explain where the other version is, when it was updated, and summarize the changes.]*  
*[If a very granular description of the versions of the dataset is needed (e.g. file by file) this section can be moved to Data and File overview.]*


3) Was data derived from another source?  
*[Answer Yes or No. If Yes, list source(s).]*  
*[If there is code in the dataset, and the code is in a repository explain how this snapshot of the code is tagged in the repository]*

## METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION


*[Describe the methodology used to generate the dataset]*  
*[Include links or references to publications or other documentation containing methodological information]*  
*[Do not copy paste the methods section from a pending publication unless you have made sure that you can do that. Some journals may consider this as a publication, and will not accept a manuscript with a section that has already been published.]*  
*[If you want to refer to an article that has not been accepted for publication yet, include as much information as you have at the moment (e.g. authors and title). If the publication has been published include the DOI in the citation. If the publication does not have a DOI (like a dissertation) include a URL.]*
